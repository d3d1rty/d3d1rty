# A User Guide to Working with Dick Davis

...because even people should come with a manual sometimes. But no, seriously, learning how to work effectively with people can be difficult. I tried to take the guesswork out of learning how to work effectively with me by writing a quick user guide. My inspiration for doing so was [an article that I came across on Hacker News by Julie Zhou](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to).

## How I view success

* Getting to the finish line. Even if it is an idea that doesn't work out, getting it delivered is the number one way that I measure how successful we are at building stuff together.
* The whole team feels good when we finish an effort. If we finish a project but are burned out and sick of each other, then we failed to deliver as a team.
* We are focused on and positively impact our KPIs.

## How I communicate

* I laugh and joke a LOT, but I don't shy away from tough conversations.
* My communications are typically detail-oriented; if you don't want the details, you should specifically ask for a high-level response.
* I prefer asynchronous communication via email for things that aren't urgent.
* If something urgent pops up outside of normal work hours, feel free to hit me up. Let's just not make that a habit.

## Things I do that may annoy you

* I can get pretty focused and intense when we are tackling a problem. Don't take it personal if we find ourselves on opposite sides of an issue, just be ready to defend the validity of your idea.
* My patience has limitations; I try to be understanding, but it really bothers me when my time isn't valued or respected. Dig into an issue a little before you come to me, or you might just get RTFM'ed.
* I'm a stickler for process. If the current process doesn't work, let's talk about it and make some changes, but don't disregard it altogether.

## What gains and loses my trust

* Be honest and straightforward.
* Don't be afraid to be vulnerable; it shows that you trust me, and I will reciprocate.
* Let's have each other's backs. If I need to know something, let me know and I'll do the same for you.
* No gossip.

## My strengths

* Anything backend or systems related is my area of expertise.
* I love challenging problems.
* I'm intensely loyal and trustworthy.
* I love seeing and helping my colleagues succeed.

## My growth areas

* I'd love to learn more about frontend stuff.
* Interpersonal communication is something I've been working on improving lately.

## How I give and receive feedback

* Give it to me early and often.
* Don't pull punches; I value directness.
* Challenge me to be better.
